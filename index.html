        <p>Hello, My name is Walter and I am from Mozambique, but currently living in Portugal. I am taking this
            class because I have recently discovered a passion for IT although I don't have a basic understanding
            of Web development and other related things, so I didn't hesitate to apply. I look forward to meeting you
            and working with each of you.</p>
